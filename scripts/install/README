I. Prerequirements.
There is so many Linux distributions that automizing full installation procedure
seems senseless. Moreover, you may have organized directories in non standard
way so it seems the best way that we do not provide automized procedure for
installing things like python or PostgreSQL.

To attempt to install RawSalad you should met prerequirements:
- python 2.7
- PostgreSQL 9.1.3 or higher
- django 1.3
- simplejson 2.3.2 or higher
- psycopg2 2.4.4 or higer
- yuicompressor 2.4.7 or higher
- PostgreSQL user with write privileges

II. Installation procedure

Installation is done by running install.py. The procedure consists of the following steps:

1. Creating and initializing tables in PostgreSQL database.

2. Changing files with application specific settings: settings.py, db.conf and rawsdata.conf.
    db.conf and rawsdata.conf: should have form:

You can also avoid running the script and do the operations on your own.
    1) psql --user <db_user> --file init_db.sql
        db_user is the user that should be able to create datatables
        (the one created in prerequirements)

    2) create files rawsalad/db.conf and rawsalad/rs/rawsdata.conf, both with content:
       [postgres]
       host: <host>
       dbname: <dbname>
       user: <username>
       pass: <password>
       
       where host - ip address of host with database (can be also localhost)
             dbname - name of PostgreSQL database
             username - name of user with table creation privileges
             password - password for that user

    3) replace values $admins, $time_zone, $language_code, $media_dir, $host_addr and $secret_key
       config_templates/settings_template.py with application specific values and
       replace rawsalad/settings.py with the file



3. Start server with:
    python manage.py runserver
